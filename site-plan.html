      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        There is a carousel on the home page that features various images, including one of our dedicated team, one of our beloved stuffed goat mascot, and one AI-generated image designed specifically for the donate slide. This carousel is not only visually appealing but also serves to encapsulate the essence of our organization. Additionally, there is a prominent button that directs visitors to both the gallery and donate pages, ensuring that essential information is just a click away. Furthermore, the home page will provide brief yet informative details about who we are and what we do. This section will articulate our vision, mission, and core values, helping visitors understand the foundation of our organization. Moreover, there may be quick links (distinct from those in the navbar) leading to the gallery, donate, sponsors, and about us pages, offering seamless navigation.

      <h3>About Us</h3>

        The About Us page will encompass a comprehensive overview of our organization, including quick links to the FIRST website and a return link to the home page. This page will also feature a concise yet engaging history of our team, detailing significant milestones and achievements over the years. Additionally, it will provide a list of current team members, highlighting their roles and contributions. This personalized touch fosters a sense of connection and community among visitors. Furthermore, there may be a section dedicated to the awards we have garnered, showcasing our commitment to excellence. Team photos will be prominently displayed here, capturing the spirit and camaraderie of our group, and these visuals will add a human element to the narrative, making it more relatable and engaging. Here will also be images of each team member individually, with a name, and a short description about their role on the team.

      <h3>Gallery</h3>
      <p>
        Page 3 will be the Gallery Page, designed to be a visual feast for the eyes. It will include a well-organized grid of images from various events we have attended. These images will capture the essence and vibrancy of our participation in these events, providing a window into our dynamic and active involvement. Additionally, there will be images from around our workspace, offering a glimpse into our daily operations and the environment where our creativity and hard work come to life. The Gallery Page aims to visually tell our story, providing a rich and immersive experience for visitors.

      <p>Images for the Page 3 (note: there are far to many to list all of them here, so I will only put 2</p>

      </ul>
        <h3>Sponsors</h3> 
        <p>
          Page 4 will be the Sponsors Page, dedicated to acknowledging and appreciating our valued sponsors. It will include a detailed list of our sponsors, highlighting their contributions and support. This page will also provide our contact information, making it easy for potential sponsors to get in touch with us if they wish to support our endeavors. Additionally, there will be a section explaining the impact of sponsorship, illustrating how their contributions help us achieve our goals. This page aims to foster a sense of community and partnership, encouraging continued and new support from our sponsors.

        <h3>Donate</h3>
        <p>
          Page 5 will be the Donate Page, which plays a crucial role in our fundraising efforts. It will embed an iframe that directly links to the Hack Club donation page, providing a secure and efficient way for supporters to contribute financially. This seamless integration allows donors to make contributions without leaving our website, ensuring a convenient and uninterrupted experience. The Donate Page aims to inspire generosity and demonstrate the tangible benefits of financial support for our organization. There may be a 6th page linked there, explaining the impact of donations and how they help us achieve our goals. But that is a big maybe.

        The carousel will have captions, but where the captions will be located will vary from slide to slide. I am also not sure how many slides I will add.
