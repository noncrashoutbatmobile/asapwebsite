About Us
Our Story
At A$APFTC26482, we are passionate about advancing robotics technology and redefining robot competitions. Our team, established in 2024 by founders Amrit Misra and Joseph Anil, is one of many Utah-based teams. 
Our journey began with a shared passion for robotics and a drive for innovation. We wanted to start something unique for the community around us.
At A$AP, we are committed to fostering a culture of inspiration, challenge, and teamwork. Our core values of innovation, integrity, and excellence drive us to push boundaries and set new standards in robotics technology. 
The FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is a global robotics competition that inspires students to innovate and excel in STEM fields. Our team builds robots to compete in these challenges, pushing the boundaries of robotics technology.
We couldn’t achieve our goals without the generosity of our sponsors and donors. Their support helps us push the boundaries of robotics technology and excel in FTC competitions. If you’d like to be part of our journey and support the future of robotics, please consider donating. Every contribution makes a significant difference.

        Page 3 will be the Gallery Page, designed to be a visual feast for the eyes. It will include a well-organized grid of images from various events we have attended. These images will capture the essence and vibrancy of our participation in these events, providing a window into our dynamic and active involvement. Additionally, there will be images from around our workspace, offering a glimpse into our daily operations and the environment where our creativity and hard work come to life. The Gallery Page aims to visually tell our story, providing a rich and immersive experience for visitors.

        This wireframe is easy, as the main section of the page is an iFrame from Hackclub. The only thing I will need to do is add a header and footer to the page.
